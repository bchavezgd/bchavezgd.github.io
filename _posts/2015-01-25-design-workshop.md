## Case study

*Brian Brourn*, of Bourn creative

Justahead.com
IOS 
Tours sold as in app purchases
- multi authors

**phase one**

- Built in browser
- Genius framework
- Smooth scroll
- Call to action consistent throughout the home page
- Opt in for making list found only on blog pages
    - this was done to attrach only visitors that have shown enough interest to browse enough to get to the blog posts.  

**phase 2**

*Content type*. Not custom post type

"discover more tours like" this is powered by custom taxonomy

Try to understand clients idea better than they can so you become more valuable to them

## copy writing tips: for people who hate to write

*Anne mccoll*

Write conversationally

- Ask, so what?
	- why are they saying what whatever they're singing
	- usp

Sub-headings should tell the the whole story

In designs leave extra room for copy

## The Human Side of UX Design

*By James Archer*

**Design = Empathy**

- Design is a process not a skill
	- study
		- get context for how product will be used
			- situation, people, environment.
	- empathize
		- what are those people doing when they start using the product, 
		- why are they using it. 
		- what would they rather be doing?
	- prototype
		- then revise.

Does anyone care about the product? Is it relevant to them?

**UX heirarcy**

- Delight
- Comfort
- Efficiency 
- Intuitiveness
- Functionality

Many people use metaphors to talk about their products, use the same metaphors that the clients do to make them happy. Ie 99% invisable show about naming buildings in south america. 

But remember, *consumer > client.* 

Without the consumer, the client won't have any money to spend. 

**Preventing Project Creep**

If the client doesn't want to pay for something then that service or product doesn't have enough value to them and not worth wasting the time/engery to work on. 

*Find out what salesforce is for, what do they sell. And look up what razors edge is.*

##Working with Developers. 

*Bryan Monzon*

Development team lead for FiftyandFifty.org

Works only with non-profits 

- kony 2012

"Building websites is exactly like planning a wedding."

Fast and cheap, like vegas, but not that good. Or you can spend an exorbinent amount of money, to get every detail "perfect."

The way designers and developers work are fundamentally different. The best way to make sure they work well together is *communication* 

Designers need to communicate the expectations of their designs to the developer and the devs need to be able to communicate back to the designers about what can and can't be done.

Look into OOP (object oriented programing). 

"Think algorithmically"

## Uncommon Design

*Taylor aldrige*

creative director at 10up

Current web site pattern: Logo + nav + Content = Website. 

Introducing the idea of "Holism" 

- the sum is greater than the parts. 
- aka Gestalt

The purpose of all websites is to **Convert** weither its for sales or comments, or shares. 

We are expecting to see certain patterens on web design, which is why the above equation works and exists. so instead of building around that and trying to get rid of it. Lets try to make it better. The new proposed equation is (B + B) x C = P or 

**Business, Brand, Conversion, Power**

Work with what people expect. Contrast used in video games is what drives people forward in the game. If what they expect is changed they become uncomfortable and will probably drop conversion rates. 

Helping conversions, 

1. Connect
	- this is done easily with eye catching designs and good content. 
2. Convince
	- usually with testimonials, but can be a "try before you buy" deal. 
3. Convert. 
	- the final goal. 

Look up Oli Gardner, [tutsplus.com](http://www.tutsplus.com) he wrote 7 principals of conversion centered design.

1. Encapsulate
2. Contrast
3. Direction cues (call to action)
4. White space
5. Urgency and contrast
6. Try to before you buy
7. Social proof
