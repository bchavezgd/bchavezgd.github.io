# MonoBlack Discard

**Deck Tech**

With Magic Coreset 2019 out, and rotation knocking out a large section part of standard, everyone is trying to break the format before it has had a chance to actually rotate. as a magic player, I'm also looking for that edge of playing an unknown, meta breaking deck. when i saw the [Mono Black Burn](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=14798&writer=Strictly+Better+MTG&articledate=8-10-2018) deck by SBMtG on youtube, i already had most of the cards, i went ahead and tried it. after a few games i found that i would win pretty easily if i was able to resolve a **Raider's Wake**, and if that went unanswered and i was able to resolve an **Arterial Flow** or **Fell Specter**, the deck could deal eight damage to my opponent in a turn. Then I remembered the card that won me three of my Dominaria pre-release rounds, **Urgoros, The Empty One**. the card reads 

> **Urgoros, The Empty One** 4BB
> Legendary Creature — Specter
> Flying 
>
> ## Whenever Urgoros, the Empty One deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card at random. If the player can’t, you draw a card.
>
> ## As the phantom flies overhead, the city of Vhelnish screams in silence.
>
> 4/3

*Urgoros* forces an opponent to discard a card when dealt combat damage. When Raider's Wake is on board, that's an extra two damage, for six total from a single combat. Then with the *raid* trigger, opponent is forced to discard another card and lose another two life, for a total of eight life in a single turn. If this effect is compounded with Fell Specter that puts an additional trigger making opponent lose two life when discarding. In this scenario  a single hit with *Urgoros* means opponent discards two cards and loses 20 life by the end of your turn.  

I wanted to go all-in with these three cards. 

First I remembered Saffron Olive's 8 Rack video, I had to take ideas from that, and other mono black discards in previous standard formats. The Deck would have a rather high cmc because it revolves around a six drop and two four drops. just these cards alone create a deck building challenge. i looked to control decks that have finishers like **Torrential Gearhulk** at 4UU, Stompy decks that can ramp out huge beasts, and tried to find ramp that's usable in a Mono Black deck. the answer was **Cabal Stronghold**, is a strictly worse **Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth** but a slightly better version of **Cabal Coffers**. *Stronghold* plus three swamps is capable of producing *BBBB* and by turn five with four Swamps, and two *Strongholds* can produce six black mana instead of four. See the article [Examining Cabal Stronghold](http://www.starcitygames.com/articles/36961_Examining-Cabal-Stronghold.html) on Star City Games to read a more in depth article about the card, and why not to use it. However, I haven't missed the utilities lands that Sam Black would rather use instead of *Stronghold*. This still left me pretty vulnerable until I was able to resolve the build-around cards on turn four. Which leaves me open to aggro decks, or midrange decks that have an aggressive slant to them. Racing in the early game would mean that i'd have to build for a completely different archetype deck that didn't have room to wait until turn four to get it's engines going. So until I could get the engine on board i'd have to protect myself, in black that meant removal.  

One of the best removal spells in standard is **Fatal Push**, it's unfortunately rotating to soon, but running four is the only number i'm comfortable with. Any less means my chances of drawing it in before turn three is way to low. In addition to *Push* I'm running two copies of **Murder** as a back up, which can destroy almost any creature in the format.  **Golden Demise** is a decently priced board wipe with the drawback of being symmetrical, which has been devastating against aggro decks that stay low to the ground, late game it can trigger the Ascend mechanic allowing it to wipe only the opponents side of the board. These cards are able to buy time until the engine gets going. 

Once the engines of Raider's Wake, and Fell Specter get online there are a few cards added to the deck that don't rely on combat to force opponent to discard. **Arterial Flow** forces opponent to discard two cards, and if I control a vampire it also drains my opponent for two. The floor of this card is that it can be a dead draw against an opponent that's already empty handed. The ceiling is that my opponent has at least two cards to discard, either *Wake* or *Specter* in play or multiples of these cards, and a vampire on board, they could lose two to ten life or in magical Christmas land up to 20 life by turn six. Even with a piece missing forcing opponent to discard two cards is frustrating and disruptive to anything they are trying to plan. To get around the dead draw issue, I play a few copies of **Unburden** which has a similar top end, but its floor is the ability to Cycle it away for two mana. I don't like running more than five discard spells as their floor is so low. 

Getting the engine going early as possible is vital for this deck. So including **Arguel's Blood Fast** for it's ability to draw multiple cards per turn is essential to digging for the engine cards. As a redundancy i'm running four copies of **Dusk Legion Zealot**, it can also be used to trigger *Wake's* Raid ability. Other then that if it eats a removal spell it's not a big lose. *Urgoros* is another card advantage engine. If I wasn't running *Blood Fast* then i'd probably like more sources of card draw. In black, and in this deck, cards equal life; drawing cards means losing life, and discarding them also means losing life. I like four copies of **Gifted Aetherborn** since it's one of the better black vampires in standard right now, it can trade up with any creature with death touch, and gains life to help lessen pain of drawing cards in this deck. it's biggest drawback is that it's a lightning rod for removal spells, and it does nothing for the knights that have first strike in the format at the moment. it's also rotating out of the format soon and i don't expect a replacement. The last creature that I run is **Vicious Conquistador**, it's such a small, non-threat, most opponents don't use their removal on it and having two toughness is every valuable in the early game, it can block most turn one creatures in standard, but its better on the attack. If i'm not attacking with the Conquistador, then i'm not making the most of the ability to ping opponent for one on its attack trigger meaning that even attacking in to another 1/2 creature still provides value. By turn four, if it's still on the board then it can force the raid discard trigger on *Wake.* Having 12 total creatures means *Arterial Flow* has a reliable drain trigger. 

This deck is fairly consistent, and pretty fun, I haven't had the chance to play against a control deck yet so testing is incomplete. Against aggro decks if I can draw into a **Golden Demise** on curve I have a great win rate. Against midrange decks, my engines work to kill my opponent even faster. Post board the deck often feels more controlling and falls in to a tempo or control build. 

My sideboard build is a bit defensive and can use an overhaul. Against aggro I board in all three **Golden Demise** to reliably wipe the board by turn three, also more removal is just good anyway. **Icy Manipulator** puts in work against decks that rely on huge creatures to finish off the game it has an added benefit of tapping down irritating artifacts, or lands, it can also be very affective against mana dorks or opponents who are mana screwed. **Moment of Craving** acts as a spot removal at instant speed to keep the board clear. **Settle the Score** is a budget version of **Vraska's Contempt** and I could probably find a better card for this sideboard slot. **Vanquish the Weak** is also to weak of a spell to keep, but the fact that it is an instant speed removal spell almost makes up for it's drawbacks. **Duress** is a staple of any black deck and I believe even more-so in this deck against control match ups. Running an extra two **Unburden** in the sideboard for control. I can't really commit to any more changes as I haven't tested it against any control decks that run any counter spells. **Deadeye Tracker** is the only graveyard hate card mono black decks have access too that is not rotating out soon.

## Testing 

To test this deck I played and tracked ten matches in the tournament practice lobby, while the data set isn't as large as i'd like. And I didn't come up against any true control decks. Not a single counter spell seen in 26 games. I did come away with some interesting conclusions: 

1. **Vicious Conquistador** was really an Allstar. 

I was consistently able to get four damage in before it ate a removal spell or opponent was able to get an effective blocker on board. Even when it was blocked it's attack trigger was able to deal one damage to opponents face. More offten than not my opponents never put their mana dorks in front of it, or just took the damage while blocking with their 1/x creatures to prevent combat damage. this usually was enough for me to make it to turn four and cast *Wake* during my second main phase triggering it's *Raid* ablility forcing opponent to discard and lose two life. While this card is not a finisher it's a seemingly innocuous enabler that can end games quickly when the engine gets online. 

1. Aggro decks are a weird match up. 

Every aggro deck I came across was hellbent by the time i had a payoff in hand. sideboarding was really a matter of being able keep the board clear with removal and sweepers, while attacking with *Urgoros.* 

1. Decks that go big are hard to beat. 

The few ramp decks came across during and before testing where decisivly one sided. my smaller creatures couldn't soak up that much damage, while **Gifted Aetherborn** could trade up with the likes of **Ghalta** it would usually eat a removal spell before it had the chance to block it. **Fatal Push** is just not effective against threats that would be in a Stompy deck. If an Opponent is able to resolve a **Vine Mare** the game is effectively over. 

## Summary

This deck is fun! the novelty of being able to win by doing six damage to opponent during my end step won't wear off any time soon. I can't say it's a solid deck because i haven't been able to test it against a control match up, but I hope to come across one sooner rather than later. the sideboard could use an overhaul, but it's not bad so far. 

Going forward after rotation i believe that going into blue will help get the engines on board reliably on curve, also cards like **Blink of an Eye** will help against aggro decks that get hellbent by boucing a blocker, and having a something to discard, and providing a painless draw spell. **Opt** helps get to my threats or engines faster, **Negate** to protect from removal, not to mention all the creatures that are bounce spells on a stick. with the arrival of *Guilds of Ravnica*, a Dimir discard deck has even more tools like **Discovery//Dispersal,** **Disinformation Campaign,** and **Connive//Concoct.** I can't say if this deck will be competitive once rotation hits, but it'll still be fun.
