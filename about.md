I'm Brian, a graphic designer. I'm also a studio photographer, and front end designer. 

So basically a a visual design ninja, that can learn and adapt to any situation that's been thrown at me. I've been looking for a position that's not just taking order, but being asked to help with ideas and feel like part of a team. I work best when I have someone to bounce ideas off of. My main skill set is in Graphic Design, taking pride in my typography and layout designs. Besides that I also have a solid understanding of HTML/CSS and Javascript/jQuery. a basic but growing understanding of PHP, mySQL, and I'm an well practiced with WordPress. 

Thanks.
